# Cryptic on paper

Encrypt messages with simple ciphers that you could replicate on a piece of paper.

## Motivation

I wanted a tool that would allow me to create robust passwords that are hard to remember but easy to calculate with a piece of paper. Ideal for creating a master password for your password manager or other important services.

## Development

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) are preferred.
