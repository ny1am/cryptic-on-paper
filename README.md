# Cryptic on paper

[![build check](https://github.com/ny1am/cryptic-on-paper/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ny1am/cryptic-on-paper/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Encrypt messages with simple ciphers that you could replicate on a piece of paper.

## Motivation

I wanted a tool that would allow me to create robust passwords that are hard to remember but easy to calculate with a piece of paper. Ideal for creating a master password for your password manager or other important services.

## Development

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) are preferred.
